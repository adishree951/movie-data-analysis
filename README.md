## Project Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive movie dataset to answer several key questions:

- **Which year had the most filmed movies?**
- **What is the distribution of movie popularity?**
- **How are vote averages categorized and distributed?**
- **Which genres are the most prevalent?**
- **Which movies had the highest and lowest popularity?**

The analysis includes clear Python code, plots for every key question, and actionable insights into trends in the movie industry.
